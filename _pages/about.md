I am a mathematics and computer science double major from Williams College 19'. During my first year of college I met many students from all over the world, and since I have been inspired to travel to each of their home countries and experience their culture. I hope to create some great travel guides so others can also get an authentic experience throughout their travels! While not roaming about, I am a software engineer and texas hold 'em enthusiast!
