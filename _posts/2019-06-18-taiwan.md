## Taipei, Taiwan ##

---
As I begin a new chapter of life, finally graduating college and entering adulthood, I delved into a different part of the world to find some piece of mind. My parents often say at my ripe age of 22, they had already entered adulthood and took on many different responsibilities, yet I can't but feel like the entire situation is so... surreal. But we can ignore some of these feelings and dive into some of the blessings the country of Taiwan has to offer.


### Cliff Jumping - Longdong (龍洞), Taiwan ###
---

On this trip one of the first activities I suggested to my friends were to go **cliff jumping** and **snorkeling** in northern Taiwan. A place known mostly to locals, and not to be confused with Luodong, this place some of the most natural beauty found on Earth. 

Directions: 
Start from Taipei Main Station and take buses 1011, 1012 from Exit M1. Then arrive at Long Dong in about 50 minutes.

### Wormhole

This spot is one of my favorite activities as you are scaling down cliffs into a beautiful natural river; however, it had come to my attention that the police have actually banned people from using this area because of a previous injury that had occurred here.
