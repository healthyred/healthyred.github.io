## Williams College ##

---

After four years stuck hermitting in the middle of nowhere, I bring myself to reflect on the experiences which have changed myself into the individual I am today. The purple mountains of *Williamstown, MA* create a serene state of mind perfect for indulging oneself in contemplations of the world. In this purple bubble, students attend **Williams College** where incredibly challenging courses lead students to find some fun activities to relax once in while. We present below a todo list for this place in the middle of nowhere.

1. Snowboarding/ Skiing at Jimminy Peak

2. Sledding down bee hill on school trays

3. Seeing the cows 

4. Visiting the Clark

5. Trying the limited food options

6. Touring Williams College

7. Attending faculty talks.
